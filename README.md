### Twilio ESB Connector

The Twilio connector allows you to connect to Twilio, an online service that lets you embed phones, VoIP, and messaging in web, desktop, and mobile software. The connector uses the Twilio REST API to connect to Twilio and work with accounts, applications, calls, messages, and more. The underlying Java classes in the connector use the Twilio Java Helper Library to make the HTTP requests to the Twilio API.
